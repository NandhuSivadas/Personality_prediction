        <h1>How the Test Works</h1>
        <p class="about-subtitle" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The test is simple and takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. Here's how it works:</p>

        <div class="how-it-works-content">

            <div class="how-step">
                <h2>Step 1: Answer 50 Questions</h2>
                <p>You'll be presented with 50 statements about behaviors and attitudes. The questions are divided into 10 pages with 5 questions each for easy navigation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each question relates to one of the Big Five personality traits.</li>
                    <li>Questions are presented in a mixed order for better accuracy.</li>
                    <li>A progress bar shows how far you've come.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="how-step">
                <h2>Step 2: Rate Each Statement</h2>
                <p>For each statement, indicate how much you agree or disagree using a 5-point scale:</p>
                <dl class="scale-list">
                    <dt>1 - Strongly Disagree:</dt>
                    <dd>The statement doesn't describe you at all.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>2 - Disagree:</dt>
                    <dd>The statement somewhat doesn't describe you.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>3 - Neutral:</dt>
                    <dd>You're uncertain or the statement partially applies.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>4 - Agree:</dt>
                    <dd>The statement somewhat describes you.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>5 - Strongly Agree:</dt>
                    <dd>The statement describes you very well.</dd>
                </dl>
            </div>

            <div class="how-step">
                <h2>Step 3: Get Help When Needed</h2>
                <p>Each question has an information icon (a small purple <strong>?</strong>) that provides a helpful explanation when you hover over it. This helps you better understand what the question is asking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="how-step">
                <h2>Step 4: Receive Your Results</h2>
                <p>Once you complete all 50 questions, you'll instantly receive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personality Scores:</strong> Your scores for all five traits.</li>
